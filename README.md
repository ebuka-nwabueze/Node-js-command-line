# Command Line Tools

This application is build on node.js to replicate the command line function of using ls to list files within a folder.


## How to run

- You need to have node.js available on your machine, and simply run the install command below. The required dependencies are located in the package.json file.  

    > `npm install`

- In your terminal, run the code 

    > `node.js index.js`

This displays the files in green and the folders bold in yellow.
